```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Reading in the game logs from the entire season
```{r}
allgames <- read.csv("/Users/quinyuter/Desktop/Chicago Dogs/Exploratory Analytics/all_games_as_of_6_4 - all_games_as_of_6_4.csv")
```

Some Data Wrangling
```{r}
## Getting only the first pitch of each hitter's AB
First.pitch <- allgames %>%
  filter(Batter_Team == "CHI", 
         Balls == 0, 
         Strikes == 0)

## Donivan Williams had two different batter names
First.pitch$Batter[First.pitch$Batter == 'williams, D'] <- 'Williams, D'
```

### Finding total swings and Swing percentage
```{r}
## Getting only batters and what happened on the first pitch
First.pitch.data <- First.pitch %>%
  group_by(Batter, Description) %>%
  summarize(Pitches = n())

## Replacing any empty values with NA
First.pitch.data[First.pitch.data == ''] <- NA

## Dropping any NA values and pivoting the dataframe
First.pitch.data.advanced <- First.pitch.data %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Description, values_from = Pitches)

## Replacing NA with 0 so we can find total First pitches seen 
First.pitch.data.advanced[is.na(First.pitch.data.advanced)] <- 0
```

Adding some advanced stats
```{r}
## Finding total first pitches seen and Swing percentage
First.pitch.data.advanced <- First.pitch.data.advanced %>%
  mutate(Total = ball + called_strike + foul + hit_by_pitch + hit_into_play + swinging_strike + foul_tip, 
         SwingPCT = ((foul + hit_into_play + swinging_strike + foul_tip)/Total)*100)

## Rounding swing percentage to 2 decimal places
First.pitch.data.advanced$SwingPCT <- round(First.pitch.data.advanced$SwingPCT, 2)

## Reordering Data Frame
First.pitch.data.advanced <- First.pitch.data.advanced[, c(1, 9, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)]

knitr::kable(First.pitch.data.advanced)
```

### Finding Hitting Stats off first pitch
```{r}
## Getting only the At Bats where the AB ended after the first pitch
Batting.stats <- First.pitch %>%
  filter(Description == 'hit_into_play') %>%
  group_by(Batter, Events) %>%
  summarise(AB = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Events, values_from = AB)

## Reassigning 0 to all NA values
Batting.stats[is.na(Batting.stats)] <- 0

## Finding total number of At Bats to be able to find things like BA, OBP, SLG
Batting.stats <- Batting.stats %>%
  mutate(PA = field_out + home_run + single + ground_double_play + sac_bunt + field_error + double + sac_fly, 
         AB = field_out + home_run + single + ground_double_play + field_error + double, 
         BA = (home_run + single + double)/AB)

## Rounding batting average to 3 decimal places
Batting.stats$BA <- round(Batting.stats$BA, 3)

## Reordering the data frame
Batting.stats <- Batting.stats[, c(1, 10, 11, 12, 4, 8, 3, 2, 7, 6, 9, 5)]

knitr::kable(Batting.stats)
```

### Merging the two data frames
```{r}
## Getting only the necessary columns from both of the data frames
table1 <- First.pitch.data.advanced %>%
  select(Batter, Total, SwingPCT)

table2 <- Batting.stats %>%
  select(Batter, AB, BA)

## Merging the data frames together
total.stats <- merge(table1, table2)

## Renaming some columns to make them more meaningful
total.stats <- total.stats %>%
  rename('Num hit into play' = AB)

knitr::kable(total.stats)
```
